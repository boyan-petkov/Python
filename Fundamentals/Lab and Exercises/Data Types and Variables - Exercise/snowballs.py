# Tony and Andi love playing in the snow and having snowball fights, but they always argue about which makes the best snowballs. 
# They have decided to involve you in their fray by writing a program that calculates snowball data and outputs the best snowball value.
# You will receive N – an integer, the number of snowballs being made by Tony and Andi.
# On the following lines, you will receive 3 inputs for each snowball:
# •	The weight of the snowball (integer).
# •	The time needed for the snowball to get to its target (integer).
# •	The quality of the snowball (integer).
# For each snowball, you must calculate its value by the following formula:
# (snowball_weight / snowball_time) ** snowball_quality
# In the end, you must print the highest calculated value of a snowball.

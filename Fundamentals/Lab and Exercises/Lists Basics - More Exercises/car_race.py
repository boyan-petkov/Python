# Write a program that announces the winner of a car race. 
# You will receive a sequence of numbers. Each number represents the time needed for the car to pass through that step (the index). 
# There will be two cars. The first one starts from the left side, and the other one starts from the right side. 
# The middle index of the sequence is the finish line. 
# Calculate the total time each racer needs to reach the finish line and print the winner with his total time (the racer with less time). 
# If you have a zero in the list, you should reduce the racer's time that reached it by 20% (from his current time).
# The number of elements in the sequence will always be odd.
# Print the result in the following format "The winner is {left/right} with total time: {total_time}".
# The time should be formatted to the first decimal point.

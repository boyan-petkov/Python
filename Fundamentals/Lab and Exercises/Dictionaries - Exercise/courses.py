# Write a program that keeps the information about courses. Each course has a name and registered students.
# You will be receiving a course name and a student name until you receive the command "end". 
# You should register each user into the corresponding course. If the given course does not exist, add it. 
# When you receive the command "end", print the courses with their names and total registered users. For each course, print the registered users.

Write a function that checks if a given password is valid. Password validations are:
•	It should be 6 - 10 (inclusive) characters long
•	It should consist only of letters and digits
•	It should have at least 2 digits 
If a password is valid, print "Password is valid".
Otherwise, for every unfulfilled rule, print a message:
•	"Password must be between 6 and 10 characters"
•	"Password must consist only of letters and digits"
•	"Password must have at least 2 digits"

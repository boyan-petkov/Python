# You are a pro MOBA player, you are struggling to become а master of the Challenger tier. So, you carefully watch the statistics in the tier.
# You will receive several input lines in one of the following formats:
# "{player} -> {position} -> {skill}"
# "{player} vs {player}"
# The "player" and "position" are strings, and the given "skill" will be an integer number. You need to keep track of every player.
# When you receive a player with his position and skill, add him to the players' pool, 
# if he isn`t present, else add his position and skill or update his skill, only if the current position skill is lower than the new value.
# If you receive "{player} vs {player}" and both players exist in the tier, they duel with the following rules:
# •	If they got at least one position in common, the player with better total skill points wins and the other is demoted from the tier -> remove him. 
# •	If they have same total skill points at the same positions, the duel is tie and they both continue in the Season.
# •	If they don`t have positions in common, the duel isn`t happening and both continue in the Season.
# You should end your program when you receive the command "Season end". 
# At that point you should print the players, ordered by total skill in descending order, then ordered by player name in ascending order. 
# For each player print their position and skill, ordered descending by skill, then ordered by position name in ascending order.

# Output
# •	The output format for each player is:
# "{player}: {total_skills} skill"
# - {position1} <::> {skill}
# - {position2} <::> {skill}

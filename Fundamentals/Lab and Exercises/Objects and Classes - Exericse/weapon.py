# Create a class Weapon. The __init__ method should receive a number of bullets (integer).
# Create an attribute called bullets to store that number. The class should also have the following methods:
# •	shoot()
# o	If there are bullets in the weapon, reduce them by 1 and return a message "shooting..."
# o	If there are no bullets left, return: "no bullets left"
# •	__repr__()
# o	Returns "Remaining bullets: {amount_of_bullets}"

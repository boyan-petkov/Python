# Create a class called Glass. Upon initialization it will not receive any parameters,
# you must create however an instance attribute called content which should be equal to 0. 
# You should also create a class attribute called capacity which should be 250 ml. 

# Create 3 instance methods:
# -	fill(ml) - fill the glass with the given milliliters if there is enough space in it and return "Glass filled with {ml} ml", otherwise return "Cannot add {ml} ml"
# -	empty() - empty the glass and return "Glass is now empty" 
# -	info() - returns info about the glass in the format "{space_left} ml left"

# Create a class called Mammal. Upon initialization it should receive a name, type and sound. 
# Create class attribute called kingdom which should not be accessed outside the class and set it to be "animals".

# -	make_sound() - returns a string in the format "{name} makes {sound}"
# -	get_kingdom() - returns the private kingdom attribute
# -	info() - returns a string in the format "{name} is of type {type}"

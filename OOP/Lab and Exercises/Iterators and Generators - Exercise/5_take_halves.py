# You are given a skeleton with the following code:
 
# Implement the three generator functions:
# •	integers() - generates an infinite amount of integers (starting from 1)
# •	halves() - generates the halves of those integers (each integer / 2)
# •	take(n, seq) - takes the first n halves of those integers
# Note: Complete the functionality in the skeleton and submit it in the judge system

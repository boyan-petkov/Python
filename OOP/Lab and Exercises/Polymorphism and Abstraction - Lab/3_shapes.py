Create an abstract class Shape with abstract methods calculate_area and calculate_perimeter. 
Create classes Circle (receives radius upon initialization) and Rectangle (receives height and width upon initialization) 
that implement those methods (returning the result). 
The fields of Circle and Rectangle should be private.

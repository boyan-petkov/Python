Create a class called Cup. Upon initialization it should receive size (number) and quantity (a number representing how much liquid is in it). 
The class should have two methods:
•	fill(milliliters) which will increase the amount of liquid in the cup with the given milliliters (if there is space in the cup, otherwise ignore). 
•	status() which will return the amount of free space left in the cup. 
Submit only the class in the judge system. Do not forget to test your code.

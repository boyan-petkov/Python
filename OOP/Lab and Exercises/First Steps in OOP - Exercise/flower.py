Create a class called Flower. Upon initialization, the class should receive name (string) and water_requirements (number).
The flower should also have an instance attribute called is_happy (False by default). Add two methods to the class:
-	water(quantity) - it will water the flower. Each time check if the quantity is greater than or equal to the required.
If it is - the flower becomes happy (set is_happy to True). 
-	status() - it should return "{name} is happy" if the flower is happy, otherwise it should return "{name} is not happy". 
Submit only the class in the judge system.

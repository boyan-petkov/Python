You are tasked to create two classes: a Pokemon class in the pokemon.py file and a Trainer class in the trainer.py file. 
The Pokemon class should receive a name (string) and health (int) upon initialization. 
It should also have a method called pokemon_details that returns the information about the pokemon: "{pokemon_name} with health {pokemon_health}"
The Trainer class should receive a name (string). The Trainer should also have an attribute pokemons (list, empty by default). 

The Trainer has three methods:
-	add_pokemon(pokemon: Pokemon)
o	Add the pokemon to the collection and return "Caught {pokemon_name} with health {pokemon_health}". Note: use the pokemon's details method.
o	If the pokemon is already in the collection, it should return "This pokemon is already caught"
o	Hint: to import the Pokemon class you should add "from project.pokemon import Pokemon"
-	release_pokemon(pokemon_name: String) 
o	Check if you have a pokemon with that name and remove it from the collection. It should return "You have released {pokemon_name}"
o	If there is no pokemon with that name in the collection, return "Pokemon is not caught"
-	trainer_data()
o	The method returns the information about the trainer and his pokemon collection in this format:
"Pokemon Trainer {trainer_name}
 Pokemon count {the amount of pokemon caught}
 - {pokemon_details}
 ...
 - {pokemon_details}"

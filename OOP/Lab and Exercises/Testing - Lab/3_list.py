# You are provided with a class IntegerList. It should only store integers. The initial integers should be set by constructor.
# They are stored as a list. IntegerList has a functionality to add, remove_index, get, insert, get the biggest number and get the index of an element. 
# Your task is to test the class.
# Note: You are not allowed to change the structure of the provided code

# Constraints
# •	add operation, should add an element and returns the list.
# o	If the element is not an integer, a ValueError is thrown
# •	remove_index operation removes the element on that index and returns it.
# o	If the index is out of range, an IndexError is thrown
# •	__init__ should only take integers, and store them
# •	get should return the specific element
# o	If the index is out of range, an IndexError is thrown
# •	insert
# o	If the index is out of range, IndexError is thrown
# o	If the element is not an integer, ValueError is thrown
# •	get_biggest
# •	get_index
# Hint
# Do not forget to test the constructor

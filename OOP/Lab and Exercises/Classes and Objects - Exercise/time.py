Create a class called Time. Upon initialization, it should receive hours, minutes, and seconds (integers). The class should also have class attributes max_hours equal to 23, max_minutes equal to 59, and max_seconds equal to 59. You should also create 3 additional instance methods:
-	set_time(hours, minutes, seconds) - updates the time with the new values
-	get_time() - returns "{hh}:{mm}:{ss}"
-	next_second() - updates the time with one second (use the class attributes for validation) and returns the new time (use the get_time() method)

Write a program that finds the difference between the sums of the square matrix diagonals (absolute value).
On the first line, you will receive an integer N - the size of a square matrix. 
The following N lines hold the values for each column - N numbers separated by a single space. 
Print the absolute difference between the primary and the secondary diagonal sums.

# Using a nested list comprehension, write a program that reads rows of a square matrix and its elements, separated by a comma and a space ", ".
# You should find the matrix's diagonals, prints them and their sum in the format:
# "Primary diagonal: {element1}, {element2}, … {elementN}. Sum: {sum_of_primary}
# Secondary diagonal: {element1}, {element2}, … {elementN}. Sum: {sum_of_secondary}".

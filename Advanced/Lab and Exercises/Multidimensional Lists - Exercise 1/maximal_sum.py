Write a program that reads a rectangular matrix's dimensions and finds the 3x3 square with a maximum sum of its elements. 
There will be no case with two or more 3x3 squares with equal maximal sum.

Input
•	On the first line, you will receive the rows and columns in the format "{rows} {columns}" – integers in the range [1, 20]
•	On the following lines, you will receive each row with its columns - integers, separated by a single space in the range [-20, 20]

Output
•	On the first line, print the maximum sum of the elements in the 3x3 square in the format "Sum = {sum}"
•	On the following 3 lines, print each element of the found submatrix, separated by a single space

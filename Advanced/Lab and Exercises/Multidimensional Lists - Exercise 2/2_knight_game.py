# Chess is the oldest game, but it is still popular these days. It will be used only one chess piece for this task - the Knight. 
# A chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated. It can move to the nearest square but not on the same row, column,
# or diagonal. (e.g., it can move two squares horizontally, then one square vertically, 
# or it can move one square horizontally then two squares vertically - i.e., in an "L" pattern.) 
# The knight game is played on a board with dimensions N x N.
# You will receive a board with "K" for knights and "0" for empty cells. Your task is to remove knights until no knights that can attack 
# one another with one move are left.

# Input
# •	On the first line, you will receive integer N - the size of the board
# •	On the following N lines, you will receive strings with "K" and "0"

# Output
# •	Print a single integer with the minimum number of knights that need to be removed

# Constraints
# •	The size of the board will be 0 < N < 30
# •	Time limit: 0.3 sec. Memory limit: 16 MB

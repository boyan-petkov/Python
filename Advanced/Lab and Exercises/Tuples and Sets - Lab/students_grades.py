Write a program that reads students' names and their grades and adds them to the student record.
On the first line, you will receive the number of students â€“ N. On the following N lines, you will be receiving a student's name and their grade.
For each student print all his/her grades and finally his/her average grade, formatted to the second decimal point in the format: 
  "{student's name} -> {grade1} {grade2} ... {gradeN} (avg: {average_grade})".
The order in which we print the result does not matter.

# Write a program which finds the longest intersection. You will be given a number N. 
# On each of the next N lines you will be given two ranges in the format: "{first_start},{first_end}-{second_start},{second_end}". 
#   You should find the intersection of these two ranges. The start and end numbers in the ranges are inclusive. 
# Finally, you should find the longest intersection of all N intersections, print the numbers that are included and its length in the format: 
#   "Longest intersection is [{longest_intersection_numbers}] with length {length_longest_intersection}"
# Note: in each range, there will always be intersection. If there are two equal intersections, print the first one.

Write a function words_sorting which receives a different number of words.
Create a dictionary, which will have as keys the words that the function received. 
For each key, create a value that is the sum of all ASCII values of that key.
Then, sort the dictionary:
•	By values in descending order, if the sum of all values of the dictionary is odd
•	By keys in ascending order, if the sum of all values of the dictionary is even
Note: Submit only the function in the judge system
  
Input
•	There will be no input, just any number of words passed to your function

Output
•	The function should return a string in the format "{key} - {value}" for each key and value on a separate lines
Constraints:
•	There will be no case with capital letters.
•	There will be no case with a string consisting of other than letters.

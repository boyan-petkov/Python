# Python
Solutions to problems from SoftUni Python
Student training repo.

I've created this repository to post my solutions to the problems in the SoftUni Python related module. All of the solutions posted provide 100/100 points in Judge. I've also atttempted to solve each of the problems using only the topics already covered in the course modules prior to the problem.
